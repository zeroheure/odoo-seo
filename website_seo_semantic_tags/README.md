# SEO Semantic Tags Plugin

This is an extension for the web editor.
It removes most of the font bar and replace it by some [Inline text elements](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#type-inline-text) :

  * `<strong>` defines important text, rendered as **bold**
  * `<em>`     defines emphasized text, rendered as _italic_
  * `<mark>`   defines marked text and highlight it
  
  * `<q>`      defines a short quotation
  * `<cite>`   defines the title of a book, a song, a movie, etc.
  * `<abbr>`   defines an abbreviation or an acronym
  * `<dfn>`    is the defining instance of a term
  
  * `<del>`    defines text that has been deleted from a document
  * `<ins>`    defines text that has been inserted into a document
  

## Limitations

* This module doesn't use summernote's built in parser, but it can handle some basic cross-node insertions.
* The elements won't toggle on and off, however they will clear with the `Remove Font Style` button
