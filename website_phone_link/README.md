# Website Phone Link or "Click and call"
Clickable Phone Link
This module add clickable links to phone and email in your website footer (and in the pre-header for Treehouse, Zap and Bistro themes for normal and mobile view).

## Why do you need this module ?

Currently mobile users can't clik on phone number to call you. That's a very bad user experience.
